1. Machine Learning is using machines to address task T that improves its performance P upon the data D.

2. Machine learning is great for speech recognition, object detection and recognition (most famously face), anomaly detection (bank freud), and game AI.

3. Labeled training has a set of dependent and independent variables.

4. Classification and Regression, undoubtedly.

5. Clustering

Anomaly detection, visualizaiton, and asociation rule learning also count. I did not know reinforcement learning is neither supervised nor unsupervised.

6. Reinforcement learning

7. Clustering (k-means would be good)

8. It depends on the data. If you have a set emails that are classified spam a priori, you can use that to train a supervised model. Otherwise, clustering should be used.

9. Online learning system allows the machine to learn on the new data (which may not require Internet connection!).

10. ?

11. Clustering relies on similarity measures. Cosine distance, euclidean distance, and manhattan distance are famous measures of similarity.

12. Model parameter is determined by learning through the data. Hyperparameter is determined before the learning takes place, and is subject to control by human.

13. Model-based learning algorithms 

14. Poor data, computational limitations, algorithmic limitations, and ?
